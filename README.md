Deployment Instructions
This project has been deployed across two web servers and a load balancer to ensure high availability and scalability.

Web Server Setup (web-01 & web-02)
sudo git clone https://github.com/Angel-ingabire/ALU-CURRENCY_CONVERTER.git /var/www/html/myapp
Set File Permissions:
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/myapp
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/myapp
Create a configuration file at /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp with the following;
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 54.175.182.240;

    root /var/www/html/myapp;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
Enable the configuration:


Copy
Edit
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Load Balancer Setup (lb-01)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y

Create Load Balancer Configuration:
upstream backend_servers {
    server 44.210.130.80;  # web-01 IP
    server 44.210.130.81;  # web-02 IP
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 44.201.211.3;  # Load balancer IP or your domain name

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
Enable and Restart:


Copy
Edit
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/loadbalancer /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Test the Load Balancer:

Visit http://44.201.211.3 in a browser and verify that traffic is being distributed between the two web servers.
